# webAPI_research_project
A flask application that uses the YNAB.com and Twilio REST web APIs to modify and send budget data to my phone.

The topic of Web Service APi's was chosen as my research project of choice while studying
at the University of South Carolina Upstate during Fall 2018, my last semester at the school.
I made an "A" grade on this assignment. The class was CSCI 599 with Dr. Wei Zhong as professor.
